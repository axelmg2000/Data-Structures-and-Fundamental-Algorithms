# Data-Structures-and-Fundamental-Algorithms
# Programming language: C++
The primary purpose of this repository is to show the implementation of some sort and search algorithms, as well as the principal and most common
data structures (linked list, stack, queue, binary search tree, dictionary, set, graph) with their fundamental algorithms. In addition, some 
interesting problems and puzzles related to the previously mentioned algorithms are included.
